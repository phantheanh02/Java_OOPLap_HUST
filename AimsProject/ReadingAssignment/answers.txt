Reading Assignment:  When should accessor methods be used?
	Accessor methods are used to access fields of an object. So getters 
and setters are both accessor methods. Observer method is the right term 
for a method that makes a more general observation about an object, 
without causing externally observable side effects. 
	You should use accessor methods rather than directly accessing 
state data because they provide an abstraction layer. Here are just two of 
the benefits that accessor methods provide: You donâ€™t need to rewrite your code 
if the manner in which a property is represented or stored changes.
	In computer programming, an accessor method is a method that 
fetches private data that is stored within an object. An accessor provides 
the means by which to obtain the state of an object from other program parts.
	It's okay for a method to return an object in terms of an interface that 
the object implements because that interface isolates you from changes to 
the implementing class. This sort of method (that returns an interface reference) 
is not really a "getter" in the sense of a method that just provides access to a field. 
If you change the provider's internal implementation, you just change the returned object's 
definition to accommodate the changes. You still protect the external code that uses the 
object through its interface.
 
Question:If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create 
a constructor method to build a DVD by category. 
Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:	
	Java does not allow to do this. 
	Because when create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor 
method to build a DVD by category, they have duplicate signatures 
(Name constructor method: DigitalVideoDisc, datatypes: String).
